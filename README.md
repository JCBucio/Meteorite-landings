# Meteorite landings classifier
This project is my final portfolio project of the [Data Scientist Path in Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/data-science).

## Overview
In this project I will use a [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/code/pylablanche/meteorite-landings-simple-analysis) of meteorite falls recorded throughout history with the intention of creating a predictive model that allows us to know where and when it is most likely that a meteorite will fall on Earth, as well as the dimensional characteristics of the object.

## Project goals
The main goals of this project are the following:

- Run an end-to-end data science project
- Become familiar with data science workflows
- Extract important insights about the dataset
